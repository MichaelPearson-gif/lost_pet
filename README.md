# lost_pet

Every day families are hurt because they have lost their beloved pet and do everything they can to try and locate them. The first thing that families do is put of lost fliers of their pet with a picture and description, but those fliers are only put up in close proximity to the family home or site of disappearence. This web application helps widen the search significantly. This application has a database that people can add to with their info about the pet that they have lost along with contact information. There is also a geographical map, using leaflet, that others can use to see all reported and current lost pets. This geographical map uses a GeoJson converter function that I have developed myself. People can also report found pets on the web application as well. The purpose of the application is to act like another tool that families and shelters can use to help safely return a beloved family member to his family.
